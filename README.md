# Personal Website
This is my personal website where I show contributions, stats, and a bit about myself

All designs are imported from Figma! This is my first experience, and I definitely give it a 10/10 for how beginner friendly it is. Code is messy because of this, I don't pay for dev mode so I use a plugin for exporting. All files can be found in [the Designs directory](./Designs/)

# Contributing
If you'd like to clear out some of the terrible code, feel free to open a pull request!
